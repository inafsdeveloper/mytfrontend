Long answer: It is my goal to dispel the misconception that building out apps programmatically is difficult.  I go through exactly how to write out components in code and many have found it very enlightening. Be brave, follow along, and you'll be OK.\n\nWebsite: https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com\nMentoring: https://www.codementor.io/bhlvoong\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/buildthatapp",
